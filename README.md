# Inventory System

This console application was created to assist users in easily tracking their book inventory. The information collected includes the book's title, author, the amount paid for the book, and the location in which the book is being stored. That information is then stored in a JSON file, which can be retrieved at any time using the List functionality of the program. The user is also able to search for a book's location to easily track it down, edit, or remove as needed.

The main menu prompts the user with four options:
1) Add a book
2) Find a book
3) Calculate total value of books in inventory
4) List all books
5) Quit

These options can be accessed by simply typing the first word in the line (e.g. "Add", "Find", "Calculate", "List", "Quit").
